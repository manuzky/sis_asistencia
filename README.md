**IMPORTANT‚ùó‚ùó:** Since this project was developed by me for my university, the **codebase, comments and database are entirely in SPANISH**.

This project was developed in **Laravel** as part of my **university graduation project**.  

The **Attendance Registration and Control System** enables efficient management of staff attendance within an institution.

‚úçÔ∏è **Personal Note:**  
Beyond being an academic assignment, this project became a **personal and professional challenge**.  
It was also the **first complete system I built entirely on my own, solo sol√≠n solito**.  
Developing it allowed me to apply my knowledge in **Laravel**, **MySQL**, and **web development best practices**, while gaining valuable experience completing a full system independently.
