**IMPORTANT‚ùó‚ùó:** Since this project was developed for my university, the **codebase, comments, database, and user manual are entirely in Spanish**.

This project was developed in **Laravel** as part of my **university graduation project**.  
It also represents an important milestone, as it was the **first complete system I built entirely on my own**.  

The **Attendance Registration and Control System** enables efficient management of staff attendance within an institution.

‚úçÔ∏è **Personal Note:**  
Beyond being an academic assignment, this project was the **first one I fully developed on my own**.  
It became a **personal and professional challenge** that allowed me to apply my knowledge in **Laravel**, **MySQL**, and **web development best practices**, while gaining valuable experience completing a full system independently.
